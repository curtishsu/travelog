**User Story**: I want to remember the coolest days that I’ve traveled.

Solution: Be able to favorite days on a travel trip

UX:

- Have a star that is right aligned to the Day [x] at the top. The star is just a outline. If a user clicks it, that day gets marked as a favorite

Usability

- On the globe, be able to filter by ‘favorites’
    - if the type is favorites, then that is the only filter, and clicking ‘filter’ will filter all travel days that are favorited as a filter
- On journal, favorite is a ‘type of filter’. If a user favorites by filters, only trips that have a favorited day will be kept
