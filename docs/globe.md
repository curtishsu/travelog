## City / Region / Country view
A toggle is available that enables the three views

### City View
When the toggle is set to city, each city that has been visited should have a pin on it. This pin should be a location design pin. 
- Upon clicking on a pin, there should be a carousel of all the days the user has logged for that location
    - Each card on the coursel is
        - Trip Name
        - Date you were there
        - Highlights
        - Any hashtags
There should be an 'x' to close the carousel. 

### Region View
When the toggle is set to region, all regions that have been visited should be highlighted. 
- Upon clicking on a Theregion, there should be a carousel of all the days the user has logged for that region
    - Each card on the coursel is
        - Trip Name
        - Date you were there
        - Highlights
        - Any hashtags


### Country View
When the toggle is set to country, all countries that have been visited should be highlighted. 
- Upon clicking on a country, there should be a carousel of all the days the user has logged for that country
    - Each card on the coursel is
        - Trip Name
        - Date you were there

If a user clicks on a pin, then it brings that country into the general view. If they click again, then it opens up a carousel. 
On the carousel, if a user clicks into that trip, then they are redirected to the 'view' of that trip on the journal section
