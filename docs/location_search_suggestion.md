Currently, there is a search functionality for a location. However, on a given trip, there's a high likelihood that a user is staying at the same city. For a given trip, include the past city names as suggestions under the search bar. if a user clicks on that location, fill in that city. 
The name should be attached to the day, as if the user has searched and clicked on the name. Not just putting in the name as a suggestion. 
If a past city has already been inputted, then that city should no longer show up under suggestions
