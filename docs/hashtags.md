For hashtags (this includes both trip types and day attributes), the way that hashtags are added should be the same. 

1. If a user taps enter or space while texting in the hashtag box, it adds the hashtag
2. If the user inputs a hashtag, then do not append it. however, if there is not hashtag, add a hashtag. For example, inputting "#food" and "food" should yield the same outcome
