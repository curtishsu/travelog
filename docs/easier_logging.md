Goal: Improve the logging experience for users while they are on a trip. 

Context:

- While on a trip, a user will want to be able to quickly log their activities as it happens.
- However, because the landing page is always the homepage journal, a user must click into the journal, click edit, and then go to the corresponding day.
- This causes additional friction in the logging experience.

Solution:

- If the user is currently traveling, as denoted by having a trip on the current day, then the landing page when opening travelog should be the current journal day in edit mode.re
