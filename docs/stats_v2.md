Updates

For the hashtag and trip types bar / pie chart section, make the following changes:
1. Trip type button is on the left and default
2. Remove the pie chart functionality
3. For the trip type section, on the right hand side it currently has the count. I would like count (percentage of trips that are this trip type). The denominator is unique trips, and the numerator is trips with this trip type. Upon hovering over the number, the tool tip should explain what the count and the number in the paranthesis is. 
4. For the trip type section, if a user hover overs a hashtag, there should be a tool tip that appears with the trip names. They should be links, that when clicked, take to the trip view section
5. For the hashtags, hoving over the hash tag should lead to a tool tip showing the "trip name [day]". Clicking on the name should take the to the trip overview of that day

The following is for the Trips per year / travel days per year. 
1. Label this section as 'Trends'
2. Currently it is a bar chart. I'd like it to be a graph with the x-axis being year and the y-axis being the metric. There should be a toggle 
3. There should be a toggle next to 'trends' saying 'year' or 'month' with default to year. Toggling this should change the x axis to be grouped by year or month. The year is "YYYY" format and month is 'MMM, YY' Format
4. On the trends, include a tool tip. 
a. For the trips per year, it should be:
* Grain (e.g. 2025 or Mar 2025)
* Number of Trips:
* List of trips that fall into the bucket (year or month) with a hyperlink to the trips. if the trip list is >3, have a button that says 'see more.' upon clicking it, all trips show

B. For the trip days per year
* Grain (e.g. 2025 or Mar 2025)
* Number of Trips:
* List of trips days that fall into the month
* List of trips days that fall into the bucket (year or month) with a hyperlink to the trips. if the trip list is >3, have a button that says 'see more.' upon clicking it, all trips show

### Trip Attribution. 
For the trips per year metric
A. A trip is attributed to the year or month that a majority of the days are in. If there are equivalent days in a trip that span the month or year, then attribute it to the earlier one. 

For the travel days per year metric
A. The travel day is attributed to the day that it occurs. When listing out the trips in a given month or year, include all trips that occurred in that time frame
